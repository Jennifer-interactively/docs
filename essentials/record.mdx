</Info>

## Recording modes

Open the Chrome extension to choose from three modes:

- **Interactive:** Records both screenshots and videos (default mode)
- **Video:** Ideal for Loom-style walkthroughs
- **Screenshot:** Captures a still image, great for adding to existing demos

## Extension settings

You'll see these configuration options:

- **Resize screen:** Set a consistent screen resolution for uniformity across demos
- **Modify page:** Make live HTML edits before capturing
- **Video settings:** 
  - Enable your **camera** to add a video bubble to your demo 
  - Enable your **microphone** to record a voiceover alongside your screen recording.

### Resize options

Press `Resize` to choose from preset resolution sizes:

- Standard desktop size
- Standard laptop size
- Standard mobile size

## How to record

1. Go to the URL you want to record
2. Press `Record`
3. Navigate through your product
4. Click the extension icon to end the recording

## Input-Based Capture Logic

Interactively automatically captures screenshots or video segments depending on your input:

- **Clicks** → Screenshot with a hotspot
- **Scroll, type, drag, drop** → Video segment
