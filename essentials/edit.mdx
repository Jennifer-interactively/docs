## How to edit

After recording finishes:

1. You’ll automatically be taken to the _Preview page_
2. Once the upload is complete, navigate to the _Edit tab_ to start editing

## Steps

Every recorded action is split into its own step based on the interaction. Step types include:

- **Screenshot**: Capture a still image when you click, with a hotspot automatically placed at the click location.
- **Video segment**: Capture continuous actions like scrolling, typing, dragging, or dropping as a video segment.

  Steps are the building blocks of Interactively demos.

   

  After recording, each interaction is automatically converted into a step — visible in the left-hand panel. Steps can be screenshots, video segments, or chapters.

  While editing, you can **add, delete, duplicate, or merge** steps.
