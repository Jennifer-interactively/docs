<Check>
  Hotspots and callouts are interactive UI elements that guide user interactions and deliver step-level instructions within your demo experience.
</Check>

## Hotspots

Hotspots are interactive, clickable areas automatically generated at each point you click during recording.

<Tip>
  **Tip:** Add descriptive text to hotspots to guide users and tell a story — rather than just labeling clicks.
</Tip>

### How to add hotspots

1. Click the `Hotspot` tool from the top editing toolbar
2. Reposition the hotspot by clicking and dragging it to your desired location

### How to edit hotspots

When you select a hotspot, editing options appear in the right panel, allowing you to:

- **Add/edit text**: Customize the tooltip text
- **Edit colors**: _Tooltip_ and _text_ _colors_
- **Toggle open by default on/off**: Choose whether text opens automatically
- **Apply to all layers: **Apply styling to all hotspots in one click
- **Adjust tooltip position**: Relative to the hotspot (top, bottom, left, right)
- **Set the destination**: Default is next step; you can link to any step in the demo
- **Delete**: Remove the hotspot

### How to add text to hotspots

1. Click on the hotspot
2. Edit the text in the right panel

### Branching hotspots

Create interactive, choose-your-own-path experiences within your demo using branching hotspots. Instead of moving users through a linear flow, branching hotspots let you direct users to any step you define — such as different features, outcomes, or user roles.

<Tip>
  Branching hotspots are useful when:

  - You want to showcase multiple use cases in a single demo
  - You’re building product tours for different personas or verticals
  - You want to create self-guided demos that adapt to the viewer’s interests
</Tip>

## Hotspot settings

To configure hotspot settings:

1. Click the `Settings` tool from the top editing toolbar
2. Navigate to the _Hotspot _tab in the right panel
3. Enable/disable **back/next buttons**: Add back/next arrows to the hotspot's tooltip
4. Enable/disable **step number**: Add the step number to the hotspot's tooltip

<Note>
  Hotspot settings apply globally to all hotspots in your demo.
</Note>

## Callouts

Callouts are text boxes that provide contextual information and can either remain static or function interactively like hotspots, guiding users to the next step.

### How to add callouts

1. Click the `Callout` tool from the top editing toolbar
2. Reposition the callout by clicking and dragging it to your desired location

### How to edit callouts

When you select a callout, editing options appear in the right panel, allowing you to:

- **Add/edit text**: Customize the text
- **Edit colors**: _Tooltip_ and _text_ _colors_
- **Apply to all layers: **Apply styling to all callouts in one click
- **Add a pointer**: direct attention to a specific location
- **Set the destination**: Default is next step; you can link to any step in the demo
- **Delete**: Remove the callout
